* manjaro
** pros
- less bloat
** cons
- not officially supported unity editor (works flawless either way)

* install
- git
- git lfs
- docker
  pamac build docker
- dotnet
  pamac build dotnet-sdk-bin
- mono
  pamac build mono

  if you do not use arch you will need to google and follow install
  instructions

* install unity editor
- make ssh keys, add them to gitlab
- clone gitlab idlegame repo

- get unity hub
  pamac buld unityhub

** specific unity version
- find the version you need
#+begin_src shell
    cd <repo-root>
    cat IdleGame/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt | head -n 1 | cut  -d " " -f2
#+end_src
- go here https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive
- get the url from the "unity hub" button (e.g. right click "copy link
  address"
#+begin_src shell
  unityhub <link>
#+end_src
- if unity hub mime type is setup correctly you should be able to
  click (I just didn't bother with it because it's a 1 time click)

- **Important** pull after you installed git lfs
  (git pull should be sufficient)

#+begin_src shell
  cd `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
  git lfs fetch && git lfs pull
#+end_src

- you can make symlinks with regular `ln -s`


* prefab merge tool
[mergetool “unityyamlmerge”] trustExitCode = false cmd = /opt/unity/Unity-2019.2.8f1/Editor/Data/Tools/UnityYAMLMerge merge -h -p “$BASE” “$REMOTE” “$LOCAL” “$MERGED”

* uri scheme for connecting to twitch
you need this if you want to connect to twitch with browser flow

- script idlegame-auth-handler in your path

#+begin_src shell
#!/bin/sh
[ "$1" = "-v" ] && echo idlegame-auth-handler version 0.1 && exit 0

echo "$@" >> /tmp/auth-handler-res

mkdir -p /tmp/cos_redirect/ && echo "$@" >> /tmp/cos_redirect/url.txt
zenity --info --text "$@"
#+end_src

- install a .desktop file in `.local/share/applications`
  (google and update this guide)
- add an entry here ~/.config/mimeapps.list
  something like
  x-scheme-handler/clashofstreamers=handler-script.desktop
- can poke Ben

* editor
choose
- pycharm (recommended for beginners if you code python)
- doom emacs (good for python, used by some people already, vim bindings)
- spacemacs (vim bindings, similar to doom, more features and more
  users, less minimalistic)
- vscode, intellij (works out of the box)

* other software
- gnu stow for dotfile management
- vim as fallback editor
- qutebrowser for a keyboard driven browser
- flameshot for screenshots
- todo: screencast software
- there is cli tools for creating jira tickets, might be a sick booster for testers
  jirazzz

* tips
- do not install program python packages on your system level,
use pyenv for that (pycharm does it auto)
- pamac bulid `python-package-name` for stuff you need on your system only

* screencasts
- I have scripts that use dmenu and ffmpeg
- can also select a window area with `slop`
- this works good for me

* cos attachments s3 bucket share ("sharex" bucket)

- install aws cli
  pamac build aws-cli-v2

- in ~/.aws/config
#+begin_src conf
[sharex]
region = eu-central-1
#+end_src

- in ~/.aws/credentials
#+begin_src conf
[sharex]
aws_access_key_id=UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
aws_secret_access_key=uuuuUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
#+end_src


#+begin_src shell
   name=$(basename "$1")
   aws s3 cp --profile sharex "$1" s3://<bucket-name>/ShareX/benj/"$name" \
  --acl public-read \
  && echo https://<bucket-name>.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ShareX/benj/"%name"

#+end_src

- use aws s3 help there is a lot of options

- this could be done as part of the screencapture job
- or using `watch` on a directory etc.


* troubleshoot
** “connection interrupted” in your browser
caused by docker
maybe this helps https://success.mirantis.com/article/how-do-i-configure-the-default-bridge-docker0-network-for-docker-engine-to-a-different-subnet


* notes
** at the time of writing I did not make airtest recording work
honestly don't really know why you want it
code your airtest with the repl running instead to have instant feedback, ask Ben to set it up
